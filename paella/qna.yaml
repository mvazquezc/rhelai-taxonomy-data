      Paella is a rice dish originally from the Valencian Community. Paella
      is regarded as one of the community's identifying symbols. It is one
      of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine.

      The dish takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook
      the dish on an open fire, paella being the word for a frying pan in
      Valencian/Catalan language. As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but
      in its modern form, it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural
      area around the Albufera lagoon adjacent to the city of Valencia, on
      the Mediterranean coast of Spain.

      Paella valenciana is the traditional paella of the Valencia region, believed
      to be the original recipe, and consists of Valencian rice, olive oil, rabbit,
      chicken, saffron or a substitute, tomato, ferradura or flat green bean,
      lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus), salt and water. The dish is sometimes
      seasoned with whole rosemary branches. Traditionally, the yellow color comes
      from saffron, but turmeric and Calendula can be used as substitutes.
      Artichoke hearts and stems may be used as seasonal ingredients.
      Most paella cooks use bomba rice, but a cultivar known as senia is also
      used in the Valencia region.

  - context: |
      Originally, paella made in Valencia was a lunchtime meal for farmers and farm
      laborers. Workers would gather what was available to them around the rice
      fields. This often included tomatoes, onions, and snails. Rabbit or duck was
      a common addition, or chicken less often.

      On special occasions, 18th-century Valencians used calderos to cook the rice
      in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. Water vole meat was one
      of the main ingredients of early paellas, along with eel and butter beans. Novelist
      Vicente Blasco Ibáñez described the Valencia custom of eating water voles in Cañas y
      Barro (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.

      Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain,
      giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in
      paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck, and sometimes snails.
      The dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word paella
      to refer to the recipe rather than the pan, according to food historian Lynne Olver.

      The most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice,
      chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans,
      runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary,
      sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water.
      Poorer Valencians sometimes used only snails for meat. Many Valencians insist that no more than
      these ingredients should go into making modern paella valenciana, and, in particular, that fish and
      shellfish are "absolutely out of the question." Another important rule, according to Valencians,
      is that fresh rosemary should not be added to paella valenciana made with rosemary-eating snails.

          Can you add chorizo to the paella?
        answer: |

  - context: |
      According to tradition in Valencia, paella is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange tree
      and pine branches and pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella. Also,
      dining guests traditionally eat directly out of the pan instead of serving in plates.

      Some recipes call for paella to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking.

      After cooking paella, a layer of scorched rice may be at the bottom of the pan, called socarrat in Valencià.
      The layer develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire.
      This is traditionally considered positive (as long as it is not burnt), and Valencia natives enjoy eating it.

  - context: |
      Muslims in Al-Andalus began rice cultivation around the 10th century. Consequently, eastern
      Iberian Peninsula locals often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings
      and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice
      becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterward, it became customary for cooks to combine rice
      with vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent.
      Along Spain's Mediterranean coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.

      Spanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish "symbolizes the union and heritage
      of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought
      us the basic food of humanity for centuries: rice."
